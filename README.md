# ThinkJava 99 Bottles 
 *Think Java Exercise 5-5.
 * The purpose of this exercise is to take a problem and break it into smaller problems,
 * and to solve the smaller problems by writing simple methods. Consider the first verse
 * of the song “99 Bottles of Beer”:
 *
 * 99 bottles of beer on the wall,
 * 99 bottles of beer,
 * ya’ take one down, ya’ pass it around,
 * 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
 *
 * Subsequent verses are identical except that the number of bottles gets smaller by one
 * in each verse, until the last verse:
 * No bottles of beer on the wall,
 * no bottles of beer,
 * ya’ can’t take one down, ya’ can’t pass it around,
 * ’cause there are no more bottles of beer on the wall!
 * And then the song (finally) ends.
 * Write a program that displays the entire lyrics of “99 Bottles of Beer”.
